# 🚁 Aero Energy Optimizer

An AI-based drone energy optimization and mission intelligence system built during a hackathon.

## 📌 Overview
Aero Energy Optimizer predicts drone battery usage, estimates mission endurance, and evaluates mission risk using machine learning and data analytics.  
The system is designed to support defense and surveillance drone missions by enabling energy-aware decision-making before mission execution.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Battery remaining prediction using ML
- Mission endurance estimation
- Mission risk assessment (Low / Medium / High)
- Energy optimization suggestions
- Interactive web-based dashboard
- Hardware-ready design with simulated sensor inputs

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Drone flight parameters are provided (altitude, payload, wind speed, duration, etc.)
2. A trained ML model predicts battery consumption
3. Mission endurance and risk are calculated
4. Optimization suggestions are generated
5. Results are visualized through a web dashboard

## 🖥️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
